# competitive coding

## problem sources
The problems in this repository have been sourced from the following websites:
- CodeChef
- HackerRank
- LeetCode

## structure
The repository is organised into three directories, one for each problem source: "CodeChef", "HackerRank" and "LeetCode". Each directory contains subdirectories for each programming language used in the solutions (currently, the repository only contains solutions in Python): "python".

Each subdirectory contains solutions to problems in that programming language. The solutions are named with the problem code and language extension.
